Assignment 2 group grade: A+

Some of your assignment 2 marks are tentative at this point: if you improve your code
based on initial feedback from the TAs, your mark will be adjusted accordingly. However,
some deductions are fixed and will carry forward.

Every group starts off with an "A++++" (yes, A quadruple-plus) for the combined
assignment 2 part 1 and assignment 2 part 2.
For each problem we find, "letter steps" are deducted depending on the type and severity
of the problem. A letter step is the difference between an A++ and an
A+ or a B- and a C+. Marks between A+ and A+++ (inclusive) are recorded as an A+.
If you lost a non-integral number of letter grade steps, we rounded in your
favour. If your group got more than 15 letter step deductions but fewer than 21, your
group mark was bumped up to a D- from an F.
If your mark was above A++++, it was rounded down to A++++.
Your mark will be converted to a percentage grade based on the University of
Toronto grading policy
(http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/general/grading-policy). Except for A++++,
which will be recorded as 100%, percentage grades will be the average of the
letter-grade range (e.g. a B will be recorded as 74.5, the average between 73
and 76).

Groups that submitted nothing at all will receive a 0.
