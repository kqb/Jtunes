Ok guys right now there is enough encapsulation that you guys can write
the methods for the class persistence.Cloud inside the persistence package
according to the Javadoc. It should not take too long and needs to be done
soon so we can have a working build.

To write persistence.Cloud you may need to learn about the interfaces of
some of the classes I have written. You don't need to worry about all the
classes, but look at least at the classes Song, SongInfo, and SongContent
and also any other class referenced in the skeleton code in Cloud.

If you finish writing Cloud you can look at the abstract classes UI and
Player, both inside the ui package. They should be fairly self explanatory.
Player is easier to extend as a concrete class first. Read all the classes
and interfaces that both abstract classes reference to learn how the code
works.
